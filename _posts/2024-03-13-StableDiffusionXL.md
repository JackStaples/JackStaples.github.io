# Introduction
## Ways to Use Diffusion
The world of [diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239) provides many options for creating images, catering to users of all skill levels and preferences.

Beginner users often opt for services like [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) or [Midjourney](https://midjourney.co/), which offer online interfaces to abstract away any complications with the model. These platforms are as easy to use as typing your request into a chatbox. However, this convenience comes at the expense of customization, giving users no ability to fine-tune model parameters whatsoever.

Consequently, users seeking greater control over their image generation process often transition to user interface tools such as [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) or [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). These graphical wrappers around [stable diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) models offer an array of configuration options, allowing users more ability to tailor the resulting images. From adjusting parameters to accessing powerful plugins for tasks such as [inpainting]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09865)), users have the ability to fine-tune their creations to achieve the desired results.

Finally, users can use python or other programming languages to run diffusion models.

## Why Code?
Now, why would one opt to use code to run diffusion models when graphical user interface (GUI) tools offer nearly the same level of configuration? It's a question worth asking yourself. While, in many cases, a GUI may indeed provide a smoother experience, there are unique strengths to coding that warrant consideration.

### Flexibility
Code inherently provides a level of freedom that GUIs simply cannot match. The versatility of code allows for an infinite number of usage scenarios, whereas GUIs are typically limited to providing the most common paths. For instance, consider the task of generating an image multiple times with slight variations to the input text and sampling method. Achieving this with a GUI would either be impractical or require extensive configuration. However, with code, it's as simple as writing a for loop.

### Learning
Exploring different configurations and their effects is valuable, but delving into code offers a deeper understanding. HuggingFace's implementation-specific pipelines, such as their [StableDiffusionXLPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_xl), provide documentation directly referencing the papers that created the diffusion models. This integration of code to documentation to paper offers a unique opportunity for immersive learning. There's no better way to gain a comprehensive understanding of a diffusion model than by actively engaging with it through code.

This tutorial will guide you through how to configure and use a stable diffusion model through code, specifically [stable diffusion XL base 1.0]( https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0).
